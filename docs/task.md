# Task
- I'm participating in my first hackathon. I put the challenge in the "challenge.md". 
- How should I start going at this? 
- In my team, my task would be to create a validator for the generated report at the end. We need to be confident that the report actually makes sense. Let's come up with a plan on how to best approach this
- If there are more things to consider, we can think and plan about it together
