🚀 **Agent validated integrated Surgical Review: Automated Image & Video-Based Documentation**

🔍 **Problem Statement:** In surgical environments, documentation is legally and clinically essential to track progress and ensure accountability. However, surgical staff often lack the time to manually compile detailed reports. This leads to inefficiencies and potential gaps in documentation quality and completeness.

🎯 **HACKATHON CHALLENGE:** How might we **use AI, ML and smart agents** to automatically generate **surgery reports** by **selecting** and **annotating** relevant images and video sequences, ensuring usability, **effcient UX** and efficiency for **post-operative review** in **Operating Room vs. Remote**?

📊 **Available Data & Resources:**

– Surgical video recordings and image datasets (including low-quality samples)  
– Metadata such as timestamps and sequence numbers  
– Annotation tools and APIs for image/video manipulation

🏆 **Success Criteria**: Automatically crop and select relevant image/video segments Rank and filter out low-quality visuals (e.g., white noise, blurry, empty frames) Enable intuitive gallery and detail views for fast selection, fast swipe selection. Support annotation and report generation Demonstrate usability on small displays (10–13” tablets) vs 24” Desktop. Maintain chronological order and allow smart relevance-based display. Test it with an Agent, by UX metrics and real User Feedback to proof products success.

**💡 Key Considerations:** Be highly automated and efficient Allow both on-device (post-surgery) and in-app (batch review) workflows Include a “Tinder-like” feature for surgeons to swipe/select images for reports Ensure access to all data while highlighting the most relevant content Respect safety zones in image documentation.
